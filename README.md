# NativeScript Image Picker
An image picker control that supports multiple selection.

For iOS it supports iOS8+ (read: it does not work for iOS7). It is implemented using the [Photos Framework](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios//documentation/Photos/Reference/Photos_Framework/index.html) backed up by UI implemented using the NativeScript UI modules.

On Android it uses Intents to open the stock image or file pickers.
